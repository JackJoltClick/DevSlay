- No immediate social proof (should show client count/revenue)
- Generic "Book Discovery Call" CTA (not specific enough)
- Missing urgency/scarcity signals
- No trust indicators visible immediately

### 2. **Value Proposition Clarity**
- Takes too long to understand the unique value
- "AI + Engineers" needs more concrete benefits
- Missing clear differentiator from competitors

### 3. **Trust & Risk Issues**
- No money-back guarantee or risk reversal
- Missing security badges and certifications
- Testimonials buried too far down
- No "as seen in" or media mentions

### 4. **Funnel Flow Problems**
- Too many sections before pricing
- No progressive disclosure of value
- CTAs not optimized for different buyer stages
- Missing micro-commitments

## ðŸš€ Optimization Strategy

### Hero Section Rewrite
**Current:** "Your MVP. Delivered in 8 Days."
**Optimized:** "Launch Your SaaS in 8 Days â€” Or Your Money Back"
- Adds risk reversal immediately
- Creates urgency
- More specific promise

### New Section Order (Optimized Funnel)
1. Hero with immediate value prop
2. Social proof bar (logos/stats)
3. "The Problem" (agitate pain)
4. "Our Solution" (AI + Engineers)
5. Mini case study (above fold)
6. Pricing (move up!)
7. Risk reversal & guarantee
8. How it works
9. Extended testimonials
10. FAQ
11. Final CTA with urgency

### CTA Optimization
**Primary CTA Evolution:**
- "Book Discovery Call" â†’ "Claim Your MVP Slot"
- "Submit Your Idea" â†’ "Get Your Free MVP Roadmap"
- "Let's Talk" â†’ "Reserve Your Launch Date"

### Trust Acceleration
- Add "2 spots left this month" (scarcity)
- Show "Last MVP delivered 3 days ago" (recency)
- Add SOC2/security badges
- Include founder photos and LinkedIn links

### Mobile Optimization
- Sticky bottom CTA bar (not floating button)
- Thumb-friendly button sizes (min 48px)
- Simplified navigation
- One-thumb scrollable sections
