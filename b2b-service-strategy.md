# DevSlay B2B Service Positioning Strategy

## üéØ B2B Service vs Product Funnel Differences

### **Current Issues (Product-Style)**
- Countdown timers and scarcity tactics (not enterprise)
- "Claim your spot" language (too pushy)
- Consumer-style urgency (unprofessional)
- Price anchoring like a product (not service)
- Emotional triggers vs rational decision-making

### **B2B Service Positioning**
- **Consultation-first approach** (discovery, strategy, fit assessment)
- **Partnership language** vs vendor relationship
- **Business case focus** (ROI, efficiency, competitive advantage)
- **Professional credibility** (team expertise, process transparency)
